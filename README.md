# SRAD-Live-Telem
SRAD Flight Computer for live telemetry.

## Overview

This project is a custom-built **Live Telemetry System** designed for high-power rocketry applications. Built around the **Teensy 4.1** microcontroller, it captures and transmits real-time data during flight using onboard sensors, SD logging, and a dedicated radio telemetry link. A secondary system handles **live video streaming** from the vehicle to ground stations.

The system is built to withstand high-G acceleration environments (up to 30+ Gs), and the design emphasizes robustness, modularity, and future compatibility with avionics used in competitions like **IREC**.
